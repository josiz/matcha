# matcha

Second project in the web-branch made with @kimsappi.

Dating app.

Back: Node.js w/ Express

Front: React

Database: MySQL

Single-page (ish)

Uses websocket.io for live chat with other users and JSON token for auth.

You can create an account, let the browser get your position and upload some pictures of yourself. After creating a profile try changing the filters and find other users who you can like. All the users that you have liked get a notification about it and if they like you back, you get the possibility to send messages via live chat.

You can also see the users that have viewed your profile, and other users can see if you have viewed theirs. You can also block users and report them.

Click on login to see available accounts for quick access..
